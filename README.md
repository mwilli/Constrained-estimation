There are two examples which are both self-contained including data files, R scripts, and output. The Deming example is taken from the 1940 paper by Deming and Stephan in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics. The second example is a simulated data set roughly based on soybean production in the US as tracked by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).
